# About Project

- Our project "IITR JUNTA BAZAAR" caters to the daily requirements of IITR JUNTA. 
- It is a buy and sell website designed to bring affordable and accessible products to the studendts of IIT ROORKEE.
Our webpage has been designed so that students from any year or course could either buy items or sell their products.

## Necessity

- When a student enters the R-Land there are lot of items that are in his/her bucket-list a lot of which they are not even aware about!
- The seniors can sell their products at affordable prices which were once useful to them and will be of great importance for the students to come, thus our webpage 
not only tackles with the financial hindrance but also aims to give the upcoming students the necessary assistance and guidance.

## Properties

- The users can sell their items by registering in the selling form. The information recorded here would be directly stored in a database. When the buyer would visit the 
category page of an item, a query would be raised and the related information would be fetched in the item page and the category page.
- If the user is interested in buying the item, the contact details of the seller would be shared on our webpage.

## Problems Faced

- While we were able to successfully store and fetch the information registered in the webpage, we faced difficulties in further rendering this information on the
template of webpages due to time constraint.
- We hope to soon tackle these issues and successfully create a fully functional "IITR JUNTA BAZAAR" website!!

## Future opportunities

- With proper understanding of databases and backend, we also hope to add a login and register page as well as add an one-to-one private chat window which enables
fast and effective communication between the buyer and the seller.

- We also hope to add a points system where students would be awarded with offers,prizes and merchendise.

- We have added an inform me option on our homepage which would send mails to the interested users on new additions of their liking.

> In future we also hope to add further colleges in our website.

## Instructions to use webpage

- The category tab in the left most corner gives a lot of categories which further expands to subcategories listing a wide range of useful items.

- We have also added a shop button on our navigation bar, popular categories and trendy items on our homepage, to ease the users in using our webpage. To sell the
items the user need to fill the selling form and upload item description.
